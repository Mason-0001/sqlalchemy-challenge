# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this challenge, I am going on a trip to Hawaii and have decided to do some climate analysis beforehand. In this challenge, I will use Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and flask to do the climate analysis.

The climate.ipynb contains the SQLAlchemy, Python, and Pandas code and contains a plot of the climate over the year, a plot of the temperature frequency of the region, and summary statistics.

The app.py file contains the flask API based on my queries that were developed the the previous file.
